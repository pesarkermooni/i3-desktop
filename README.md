#### 2. Recommendations:
* Be sure to read the all sources.
* My monitor is 1024x768 resolution. :) So should the files be changed according to your resolution.
* All existing script, were written based on personal need.
* "aptlist.sh" script, specific to `Debian-based` distributions as well. For other distributions should change script.
* All temporary files in `/tmp/` saved.
* You can see the font "awesome icons" in the "Libreoffice".
